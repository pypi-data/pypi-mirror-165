DataRobot is a client library for working with the `DataRobot`_ platform API. This package is the "early access" version of the client. **Do NOT use this package in production--you will expose yourself to risk of breaking changes and bugs.** For the most stable version, see the quarterly release on PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/datarobot/.

This package is released under the terms of the DataRobot Tool and Utility Agreement, which
can be found on our `Legal`_ page, along with our privacy policy and more.

Installation
=========================
Python >= 3.7 are supported.
You must have a datarobot account.

::

   $ pip install datarobot_early_access

Usage
=========================
The library will look for a config file `~/.config/datarobot/drconfig.yaml` by default.
This is an example of what that config file should look like.

::

   token: your_token
   endpoint: https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2

Alternatively a global client can be set in the code.

::

   import datarobot as dr
   dr.Client(token='your_token', endpoint='https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2')

Alternatively environment variables can be used.

::

   export DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN='your_token'
   export DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT='https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2'

See `documentation`_ for example usage after configuring.
