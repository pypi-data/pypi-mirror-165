simtex (simplified LaTeX) allows you to convert your markdown or text lectures
into LaTeX file with one command, configured with simple `.json` file.

to simplify the process of turning your already existing markdown/text file
into PDF with LaTeX.

# Features

The program allows the user to convert simple file such as markdown or text
file of its assignment/lecture into PDF using LaTeX. This program does not
intend to compete with pandoc, which essential does the same, but on a higher
level, however, produces a very complex transcription of the input, another
reason why this program is created, to create a simple LaTeX transcript of the
input. Currently, the program has features that can satisfy conversion of basic
inputs:

1. Supports the most basic commands, such as **bold**, _italics_,
**_emphasize_**, `inline code`, quotes, as well as hyperlinks.
2. Environments, the program supports a multiline math environment using
`align`, single line math equation using `equation` environment, as well as
code blocks using `lstlisting` with syntax highlighting.
3. Figures.
4. Sections, subsections upto subparagraphs.
5. Basic document metadata and properties that can be provided in a
configuration file for default value, this includes, author, date, font, among
others, view the [short documentation](./examples/config/README.md) for full
list.
6. Simple [config file](./examples/config/simtex.json) using JSON, which
defines the rules that should be followed on how the program should parse the
input, as well as how to format the document.

Refer to the [PDF](./examples/1/hello.pdf) for more details.

# Examples

You can view the output of the program [here](./examples/1/hello.pdf) which was
generated using the command:

```
simtex -c -i="./examples/1/hello.md" -T="Hello Simtex!" -of="./examples/1" -f="hello.tex" -a="iaacornus" -d="August 15, 2552"
```

> View [`./examples/1/hello.md`](./examples/1/example.md)

> View output: [.examples/1/hello.pdf](./examples/1/hello.pdf)

To convert a LaTeX file, and rename the default author defined in
`$CONF_PATH/simtex.json`, add `-a="iaacornus (or your name)`, and with the
date, `-d="August 15, 2552`.
See the [documentation of arguments and configuration file](./examples/config/README.md).
