Description: # qubolite
        
        A light-weight toolbox for working with QUBO instances in NumPy.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install qubolite
        ```
        
        This package was created using Python 3.10, but runs with Python >= 3.8.
        
        
        ## Version Log
        
        * **0.2** Added problem embeddings (binary clustering, subset sum problem)
        * **0.3** Added `QUBOSample` class and sampling methods `full` and `gibbs`
        * **0.4** Renamed `QUBOSample` to `BinarySample`; added methods for saving and loading QUBO and Sample instances
        * **0.5** Moved `gibbs` to `mcmc` and implemented true Gibbs sampling as `gibbs`; added `numba` as dependency
            * **0.5.1** changed `keep_prob` to `keep_interval` in Gibbs sampling, making the algorithm's runtime deterministic; renamed `sample` to `random` in QUBO embedding classes, added MAX 2-SAT problem embedding
        * **0.6** Changed Python version to 3.8; removed `bitvec` dependency; added `scipy` dependency required for matrix operations in numba functions
            * **0.6.1** added scaling and rounding
            * **0.6.2** removed `seedpy` dependency
            * **0.6.3** renamed `shots` to `size` in `BinarySample`; cleaned up sampling, simplified type hints
            * **0.6.4** added probabilistic functions to `qubo` class
            * **0.6.5** complete empirical prob. vector can be returned from `BinarySample`
