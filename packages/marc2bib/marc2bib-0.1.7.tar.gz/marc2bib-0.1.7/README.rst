marc2bib is a Python package that allows to convert bibliographic
records from MARC 21 format to BibTeX entries.

Installation
------------

marc2bib is available on PyPI:

.. code:: sh

	$ pip install marc2bib

Or for development:

.. code:: sh

	$ git clone https://github.com/xymaxim/marc2bib
	$ pip install -e marc2bib

Quickstart
----------

The package works along with `pymarc
<https://gitlab.com/pymarc/pymarc>`_ utilized to read MARC files. If
you have not used it before, nothing to worry about. Let's read some
data from a MARC file and convert it to a BibTeX entry:

.. code:: python

          >>> from pymarc import MARCReader
          >>> from marc2bib import convert

          >>> with open("file.mrc", "rb") as f:
          ...     reader = MARCReader(f)
          ...     record = next(reader)  # read the first record
          ...     print(convert(record)) # convert it to a BibTeX entry
          ...
          @book{author2022,
           author = {Author, Name},
           . . .
          }

And that is it!
	  
More examples

Tag-functions
*************

To parse a value of BibTeX tags (fields), we use so-called
tag-functions. Currently ``marc2bib`` fully supports book BibTeX
entriesâ€”the tag-functions are defined for the related required
and optional tags. The user can extend or override them easily:

.. code:: python

	  from marc2bib import BOOK_REQ_TAGFUNCS

	  def title_title(record):
	      return BOOKS_REQ_TAGFUNCS["title"](record).title()
	      
	  convert(record, tagfuncs={"title": title_title}) 

Customizing return
******************

The returned tags can be either all (required and optional),
only required (default), or required with user-defined ones:

.. code:: python

	  # Return required tags and "pages"
	  convert(record, include=["pages"]) # or 'all', 'required' 

A note: if you use tag-functions, no need to specify these tags for
including separately.

Convert to BibTeX or just map tags
**********************************

The main function of this package is ``convert(...)``. It combines two
steps: (1) mapping MARC fields to BiBTex tags and (2) converting the
tags to BibTeX string. However, instead of converting MARC data to
BibTeX string in one call, you can first map it to a dictionary of
BibTeX tags (fields) for inspection or post-processing (step 1):

.. code:: python

	  >>> from marc2bib import map_tags

	  >>> tags = map_tags(record)
	  >>> print(tags["author"])
	  Author, Name

Then, you can convert these mapped tags to a BibTeX string (step 2): 

.. code:: python

	  >>> from marc2bib import tags_to_bibtex

	  >>> new_bibkey = tags["author"].split(",")[0] + tags["year"]
	  >>> # By the way, the indentation is customizable.
	  >>> bibtex = tags_to_bibtex(tags, bibkey=new_bibkey, indent=4)
	  >>> print(bibtex)
	  @book{Author2022,
              author = {Author, Name},
              . . .
          }

Of course, the example below can be coded with ``convert(...)``
function and the choice depends on your needs:

.. code:: python

	  # The bibkey argument can be callable.
	  def new_bibkey(tags):
	     return tags["author"].split(",")[0] + tags["year"]
	     
	  convert(record, bibkey=new_bibkey, indent=4)

Removal of ISBD punctuation
---------------------------

In the MARC 21 format, the fields and subfields historically may
contain and be separated by terminal periods and various punctuation
marks
[https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/isbdmarc2016.pdf]. However, in
BibTeX entries we do not need it. To clean up such punctuation we
partially follow rules described in the link above (Appendix C). The
initials, ordinal numbers and some common abbreviations from AACR2R
[https://www.worldcat.org/title/847471922] (Appendix B) are kept.

Testing
-------

For testing the package we use `pytest
<http://pytest.org/latest/>`_. In order to run tests, check out
the repository and type:

.. code::

	$ pytest

By default, it runs all tests excluding validation test to do quick
testing. The validation test was added for testing the removal of ISBD
punctuation on two NLM's test record sets, with some punctuation
removed and not removed, from
[https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/test-records-punctuation.html]. For
all tests, do:

.. code::

	$ pytest --runall
