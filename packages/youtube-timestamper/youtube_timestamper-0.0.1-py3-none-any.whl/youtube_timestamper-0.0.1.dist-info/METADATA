## How to use

In this example, we look at [Sanyam Bhutani’s interview of Kaggle legend
Chris Deotte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGCvycOXs2M).

This interview contains a wealth of knowledge but it’s not timestamped
with chapter divisions. This library can help create timestamped
chapters by picking out the questions in Question-Answer style videos.

To start, simply import
[`YoutubeTimestamper`](https://ilangurudev.github.io/youtube-timestamper/core.html#youtubetimestamper)
from `youtube_timestamper.core` and pass in a youtube video url.

``` python
from youtube_timestamper.core import YoutubeTimestamper
```

    00:00:00 Introduction
    00:01:08 how did he transition into data science and cargill and his journey on kaggle?
    00:02:23 can you tell us a bit more about that, chris, now that you remember of it the secret?
    00:02:48 did you get your invite to the fight clubs yet, or can you share a bit about those?
    00:04:44 then i, um i graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and then, um, immediately afterwards, i?
    00:07:19 when did kaggle come into the picture? when did you find your addiction for kagan?
    00:08:28 you know you build a model and is your model more accurate than the other guy's model?
    00:10:15 how did you go from just starting your journey to today being the forex grandmaster? how would you advise? what should they read? what should they learn? do you think there's such a list?
    00:11:49 was it part of the enjoyment process, just getting involved, or were you making a conscious effort to? you know, maybe list down points where you need to improve?
    00:12:40 and even if a competition or something looks similar to a previous one, i say to myself: you know, what new angle can i do here? you know what new thing can i learn?
    00:13:49 any favorite battle stories you that you might remember?
    00:14:33 so there's many competitions and you see the leaderboard and there's a bunch of scores and there's, you know, the top 50, they have a little bit of a jump, and there's and people in the forum say: you know magic, what's the magic?
    00:16:03 um, do you, do you have any uh, rigid approach to competitions now, or did you compete in any in parallel, or do you just stick to one? and what's your approach in general to competitions now?

    00:25:45 thank you, um, what advice would you have for uh, newbies who are looking to write kernels?
    00:30:58 what, what advice would you have for them? they're just chasing uh, maybe the title, since it's gamified, does it annoy you? do you have any uh advice for such people?
    00:32:51 uh, any favorite memories from discussions that you might have?
    00:34:37 and then someone says, wow, that's awesome, hey, have you thought about doing this?
    00:35:35 um, what advice would you have for people who people, many people, seek teaming up because they may be asking to just compete by themselves? but what teaming advice would you have for people in general? or what's your strategy?
    00:38:47 what's your reason for investing so much time into kagan?
    00:38:58 you know people might see it and say, why is he doing so much for the community? you know, how have i, how have i, you know, learned these ideas so well?

    00:47:11 how do you, chris, how do you manage your time? what's, what's your secret to time management?
    00:49:44 but, as i said, you know, if someone's like, hey, can you? you know, can you follow the?
    00:50:30 uh, is it okay if we do a quick rapid fire questions? uh, a set of questions? so what would you like? so, would you like to me give short answers?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A nice starting point! As we can see,

-   The suggestions contain *all questions* - that means the
    interviewee’s questions too (*and then someone says, wow, that’s
    awesome, hey, have you thought about doing this?*).
-   Sometimes the questions don’t provide the complete context - they
    look like tarantino chapter titles. (*i mean, how does a computer
    know how to draw dogs?*)
-   The questions are too long and need to be summarized. (*how did you
    go from just starting your journey to today being the forex
    grandmaster? how would you advise? what should they read? what
    should they learn? do you think there’s such a list?*)
-   The youtube transcripts also contain a ton of typos (*kagan, forex
    grandmaster*)
-   Sometimes some questions are missed - the model is not perfect.

But I can just edit these timestamps and clean them up quickly manually
as opposed tostarting from scratch. I remove

-   Irrelevant questions
-   Summarize questions neatly (and sometimes go back to the video to
    get enough context)
-   Correct typos
-   Look for large gaps where there are no chapters and manually insert
    titles if need be.
