# About
This library allows you to upload a signed image to cloudinary effectively.

    pip install cloudinary-upload

Configure `.env` with your cloudinary credentials. <br>

    CLOUDINARY_NAME=xxxxxxx
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxx
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx

    from cloudinary_upload import upload_image_cloudinary

    upload_true = upload_image_cloudinary(image_file="/path/to/image.png")
