    Commands dictate what subsystems do at what time. They are scheduled
    when a :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.actions.Action.poll`
    bound condition is met. Commands are also synchronous, meaning they
    are always blocking the scheduler's event loop and should complete
    quickly.

    Commands have the following life cycle in the scheduler:

    **1.** New commands have their :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.commands.Command.initialize`
    method called.

    **2.** Actions bound to this command have their :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.actions.Action.poll`
    method called. Depending on how a command is bound to an action, the
    scheduler may skip directly to step 4 for a command.

    **3.** The scheduler now periodically executes these new commands by
    calling their :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.commands.Command.is_finished`
    and :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.commands.Command.execute`
    methods, in that order.

    **4.** Whether through an action or :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.commands.Command.is_finished`,
    commands have their :py:meth:`~command_based_framework.commands.Command.end`
    methods called and are removed from the stack.

    Commands also maintain their state after being unscheduled as long
    as a reference is maintained. The scheduler maintains a reference as
    long as the command is scheduled, but releases it immediately after.
