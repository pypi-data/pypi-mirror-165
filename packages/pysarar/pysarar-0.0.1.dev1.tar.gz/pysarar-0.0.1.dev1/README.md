# pysarar
A python implementation for SARAR(R,S) estimation

## Goal of the project
This package aims to provide a python implementation of the Badinger-Egger estimator of SARAR(R,S) models.

At the moment, the model outputs the TSLS estimates for the exogenous variables and spatial autoregressive terms, and the GMM estimates for the spatial autoregressive disturbances. The FGTSLS estimates and the optimal weighting matrix are not implemented yet.

## Installation

`pip install pysarar`
