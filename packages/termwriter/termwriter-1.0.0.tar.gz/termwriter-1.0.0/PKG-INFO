        Organize your terminal output
        
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Dumping a ton of information to the terminal using `print()` can cause the data
        you want to see on the screen to scroll up, away from the visible terminal
        area.  This can be particularly frustrating because today's monitors have a lot
        more horizontal screen space but the data scrolls away vertically.  What if
        `print()` can better organize the output to maximize the screen real estate?
        
        
        ## Example
        
        See [example.py] for an example code. Below is its output.
        
        ```
        ================================ Example Output =================================
        Some description goes here.
        
        -------- My First Box -------- ----------------- My Second Box ------------------
        This is a text box.            This is another text box.
                                       You can have a second line
                                       and it stays in the second box.
        
        --------------- My Third Box ---------------- ---------- My Fourth Box ----------
        This box is to the right of the second box.   This box stretches to fit the row
        Unless you have a narrow screen --            because we draw SoftBreak()
        then the box wraps to the next row
        
        ------- My Fifth Box -------- ------ My Sixth Box ------ ---- My First Table ----
        Notice the rows are jusified. You can also have tables.    # First Name Last Name
                                                                 --- ---------- ---------
                                                                   1 John       Doe
                                                                  10 Jane       Doe
                                                                 100 John       Public
        
        ----- My Eighth Box -----
        You can also nest boxes.
        Below is a table box.
