    This implementation is about 4x faster with record batches of 50,000, and 10x
    faster on batches of 500 than a naive Python string slicing implementation.

    However, this implementation is slower on large batches due to memory allocation,
    but as Opteryx works on data pages at-a-time, this is unlikely to be encountered.
