Description: # pyroborock_fork

        This is a fork of the pyroborock package which attempts to update dependancies and requirements so vacuums can be added to homeassitant.
        
        From the original author who really deserves all the credit:
        
        See https://github.com/89jd/roborock_comms for details on how I go to this point.
        
        Using the keys from roborock app, it is possible to communicate with the roborock without needing to use the Xiamoi Miio app.
        
        It creates a new class overriding the python-miio vacuum class, but uses the tuya-ipc library to communicate
