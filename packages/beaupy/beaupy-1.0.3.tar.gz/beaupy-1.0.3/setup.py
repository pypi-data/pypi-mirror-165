It is based on another library with which it shares some of the source code, [`cutie`](https://github.com/kamik423/cutie), developed by [Kamik423](https://github.com/Kamik423). It has begun as a fork but has since diverged into it\'s own thing and as such, detached from the original repository.\n\n## Overview\n\n**BeauPy** implements a number of common interactive elements:\n\n| Function                                                                                                  | Functionality                                                                              |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [`select`](https://petereon.github.io/beaupy/api/#select)                        | Prompt to pick a choice from a list                                                        |\n| [`select_multiple`](https://petereon.github.io/beaupy/api/#select_multiple)      | Prompt to select one or multiple choices from a list                                       |\n| [`confirm`](https://petereon.github.io/beaupy/api/#confirm)                      | Prompt with a question and yes/no options                                                  |\n| [`prompt`](https://petereon.github.io/beaupy/api/#prompt)                        | Prompt that takes free input with optional validation, type conversion and input hiding |\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**BeauPy** is a library of interactive TUI elements for CLI applications.\n\n**BeauPy** is\n\n- [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) friendly\n- stylable\n- opinionated\n- configurable\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom PyPI:\n\n```sh\npip install beaupy\n```\n\nFrom source:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/petereon/beaupy.git\npoetry build\npip install ./dist/beaupy-{{some-version}}-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n### Example\n\n![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petereon/beaupy/master/example.gif)\n\nTUI elements shown in the above gif are the result of the follwing code:\n\n```python\nimport beaupy\n\n\ndef main():\n    """Main."""\n    if beaupy.confirm("Are you brave enough to continue?"):\n        names = [\n            "Arthur, King of the Britons",\n            "Sir Lancelot the Brave",\n            "Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot",\n            "Sir Bedevere the Wise",\n            "Sir Galahad the Pure",\n        ]\n\n        name = beaupy.select(names, cursor_index=3, cursor="🏰")\n        print(f"Welcome, {name}")\n        # Get an integer greater or equal to 0\n        age = beaupy.prompt("What is your age?", target_type=int, validator=lambda val: val > 0)\n        nemeses_options = [\n            "The French",\n            "The Police",\n            "The Knights Who Say Ni",\n            "Women",\n            "The Black Knight",\n            "The Bridge Keeper",\n            "The Rabbit of Caerbannog",\n        ]\n        print("Choose your nemeses")\n        # Choose multiple options from a list\n        nemeses = beaupy.select_multiple(nemeses_options)\n        # Get input without showing it being typed\n        quest = beaupy.prompt("What is your quest?", secure=True)\n        print(f"{name}\'s quest (who is {age}) is {quest}.")\n        if nemeses:\n            if len(nemeses) == 1:\n                print(f"His nemesis is {nemeses[0]}.")\n            else:\n                print(f\'His nemeses are {" and ".join(nemeses)}.\')\n        else:\n            print("He has no nemesis.")\n```\n\nFor more information refer to [more_examples](https://petereon.github.io/beaupy/examples/) or definitive, but much less exciting [api documentation](https://petereon.github.io/beaupy/api/)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis repository has a [associated GitHub project](https://github.com/users/petereon/projects/3/views/1) where work that is currently done can be seen\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute, please feel free to suggest features or implement them yourself.\n\nAlso **please report any issues and bugs you might find!**\n\n### Development\n\nTo start development you can clone the repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/petereon/beaupy.git\n```\n\nChange the directory to the project directory:\n\n```sh\ncd ./beaupy/\n```\n\nThis project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager. You can install the dependencies using:\n\n```sh\npoetry install\n```\n\nFor testing, this project relies on [`ward`](https://github.com/darrenburns/ward). It is included as a development dependency, so\nafter installing the dependencies you can simply execute the following:\n\n```sh\npoetry run poe test\n```\n\nAfter you have made your changes, create a pull request towards a master branch of this repository\n\nLooking forward to your pull requests!\n\n## License\n\nThe project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n',
