Finetuner allows one to tune the weights of any deep neural network for better embeddings on search tasks. It
accompanies [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) to deliver the last mile of performance for domain-specific neural search
applications.

ðŸŽ› **Designed for finetuning**: a deep learning tool for leveling up your pretrained models in domain-specific neural search applications.

ðŸ”± **Powerful yet intuitive**: Finetuner unlocks rich features such as
siamese/triplet network, metric learning, self-supervised pretraining, layer pruning, weights freezing, dimensionality reduction.

ðŸ§ˆ **DocArray integration**: buttery smooth integration with DocArray, reducing the cost of context-switch between experiment
and production.

## Install

Requires Python 3.8 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)(>=1.9) installed on Linux/MacOS.

To install the `finetuner-core` repo:
```bash
python setup.py --target=finetuner install
```

To only install the shared components between `finetuner-core` and `finetuner-client`:

```bash
python setup.py --target=commons install  # include tailor, process, collate
python setup.py --target=stubs install  # include all model stubs and callback stubs and config
```
