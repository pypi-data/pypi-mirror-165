# Automation Engine

A lightweight and flexible framework to automate things with MQTT.

## What is Automation Engine?

Automation Engine is a Python framework for building automations using MQTT. The most common use case for this is automating a smart home where devices publish their state to a MQTT broker.

The leading self-hosted solution for this at the time of writing is [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), which is a great piece of open-source software. However, the automations framework in Home Assistant is quite limited, and you usually have to build multiple flows to achieve a single "automation".

Automation Engine is intended for home automation enthusiasts who prefer writing short snippets of Python, rather than building a large number of GUI "flows". As such, Automation Engine is similar to [NodeRED](https://nodered.org), but uses Python rather than a browser-based editor.

## Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus metrics are exposed on port `9832` by default. The port can be configured via the `metrics_port` config key.
