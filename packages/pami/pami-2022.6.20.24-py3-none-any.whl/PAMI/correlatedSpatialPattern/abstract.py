class frequentPatterns(ABC):
    """ This abstract base class defines the variables and methods that every frequent pattern mining algorithm must
        employ in PAMI


       Attributes
        -----------
        iFile : str
            Input file name or path of the input file
        minSup: integer or float or str
            The user can specify minSup either in count or proportion of database size.
            If the program detects the data type of minSup is integer, then it treats minSup is expressed in count.
            Otherwise, it will be treated as float.
            Example: minSup=10 will be treated as integer, while minSup=10.0 will be treated as float
        startTime:float
            To record the start time of the algorithm
        endTime:float
            To record the completion time of the algorithm
        finalPatterns: dict
            Storing the complete set of patterns in a dictionary variable
        oFile : str
            Name of the output file to store complete set of frequent patterns
        memoryUSS : float
            To store the total amount of USS memory consumed by the program
        memoryRSS : float
            To store the total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program

        Methods
        --------
        startMine()
            Mining process will start from here
        getFrequentPatterns()
            Complete set of patterns will be retrieved with this function
        savePatterns(oFile)
            Complete set of frequent patterns will be loaded in to a output file
        getPatternsAsDataFrame()
            Complete set of frequent patterns will be loaded in to data frame
        getMemoryUSS()
            Total amount of USS memory consumed by the program will be retrieved from this function
        getMemoryRSS()
            Total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program will be retrieved from this function
        getRuntime()
            Total amount of runtime taken by the program will be retrieved from this function
