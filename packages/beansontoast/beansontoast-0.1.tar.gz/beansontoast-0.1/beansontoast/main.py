# \n = new line

# Weird windows way of working I just don't get

# so this will work fine right
print("Something on one line" + "\n" + "Something on the other")
# and so will this
print("Something on one line\nSomething on the other")
# but for some weird reason Windows doesn't like directly plonking \n on ANY coding language

# example:
# this won't work
print("Something on one line" + \n + "Something on the other")
