PyDogCeo
===========


PyDogCeo is a thin wrapper on top of the [DogCEO-API](https://dog.ceo).

raised as HTTPError exceptions from the Requests library.

dog = PyDogCeo()
r = dog.breeds.listAll()
```

dog.breeds.listAllRandom()
dog.breeds.listAllRandomNumber(10)
dog.breeds.listMaster()
dog.breeds.listMasterRandom()
dog.breeds.listMasterRandomNumber(3)

dog.breeds.image.random()
