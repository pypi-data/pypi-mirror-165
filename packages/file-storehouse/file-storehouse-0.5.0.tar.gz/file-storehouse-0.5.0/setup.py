For instance:\n\n  ```python\n  # Store data to a file:\n  file_manager[id] = file_content\n  # Retrine data from a file\n  file_content = file_manager[id]\n  # Delete a file\n  del file_manager[id]\n  # Loop through all files\n  for id, content in file_manager.items():\n      pass\n  # and many more...\n  ```\n\n* Engine - Choose the engine (or back-end) your file managers are connected to:\n\n  * S3 buckets, powered by [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html);\n  * Local filesystem and more are planned.\n\n* Key Mapping - Customize a two-way key mapping between the dict-like keys and the files' location at the engines according to the business rules of your application.\n\n* Transformations - Configure a chained operation to convert the files back and forward between your Python code and the storage. The supported operations are:\n\n  * Encode/decode bytes and strings;\n  * Dump/load Json files;\n  * Compress/decompress tarballs and more transformations are planned.\n\n## Example\n\nPlease, take a look at the [user story](tests/test_user_story.py) used for testing.\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nÂ© 2022 Felipe N.
