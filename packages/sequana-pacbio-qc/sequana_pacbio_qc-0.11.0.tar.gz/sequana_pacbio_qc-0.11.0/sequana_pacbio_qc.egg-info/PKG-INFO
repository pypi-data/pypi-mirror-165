        This is is the **pacbio_qc** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ projet
        
        :Overview: Quality control for pacbio datafiles (raw data or CCS files). 
        
        :Input: BAM files provided by Pacbio Sequencers. 
        :Output: HTML reports with various plots including taxonomic plot
        :Status: production

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Just install this package::
        
            pip install sequana_pacbio_qc
        
        You will need **kraken2** (optional) for the taxonomic analysis.
        
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            sequana_pacbio_qc --help
            sequana_pacbio_qc --input-directory DATAPATH
        
        
        If you want to filter out some BAM files, you may use the pattern in tab 'input data'.
        
        In the configuration tab, in the kraken section add as many databases
        as you wish. You may simply unset the first database to skip the taxonomy, which
        is experimental.
        
        
        This creates a directory with the pipeline and configuration file. You will then need
        to execute the pipeline::
        
            cd pacbio_qc
            sh pacbio_qc.sh  # for a local run
        
        This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can 
        retrieve the pipeline itself and its configuration files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::
        
            snakemake -s pacbio_qc.rules -c config.yaml --cores 4 --stats stats.txt
        
        Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/main/sequanix.html>`_ interface.
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipelines requires the following executable(s):
        
        - sequana
        - kraken2
        - multiqc

        Details
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipeline takes as inputs a set of BAM files from Pacbio sequencers. It
        computes a set of basic statistics related to the read lengths. It also shows
        some histograms related to the GC content, SNR of the diodes and the number of passes
        Finally, a quick taxonomy can be performed using Kraken. HTML reports
        are created for each sample as well as a multiqc summary page.
        
        Kraken databases are not provided with the pipeline. This step is optional and
        not used by default.
