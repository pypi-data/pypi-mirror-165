    The `EnergyTerm` class is an abstract base class that defines

    The `@abc.abstractmethod` decorator tells Python that
    the `effective_field` method is an abstract method.

    This means that the `effective_field` method must be implemented
    by any class that inherits from `EnergyTerm`.
