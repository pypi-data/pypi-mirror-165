SwifTCR is a Python package provides a relatively quick way to find all sequences with shared single-only-replacement, only-deletion or both, creating clusters of CDR3s highly similar and construct a network graph. The tool, designed to enable researchers to quickly identify clusters in a relatively small data-set, is also available for large-scale data collection thanks its implementation of Spark, making it available for big-data immunological analysis.
