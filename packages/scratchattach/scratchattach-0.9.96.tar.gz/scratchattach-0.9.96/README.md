Scratchattach is a modern and object oriented library for the Scratch website with support for all sorts of site features.
Automate actions and interact with your Scratch projects through cloud variables.

**Some functions require logging in to Scratch.**
**You also need to have the coding language Python installed on your computer.**
*Download Python here if you don't have it: https://www.python.org/downloads/*

The project is maintained by TimMcCool: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TimMcCool/

# Installation

To install the library, run the following command in your command prompt
/ shell:
```
pip install scratchattach
```

**OR**

Add this to your Python code:
```python
import os

os.system("pip install scratchattach")
```

# Logging in  `scratch3.Session`

**Logging in with username / password:**

```python
import scratchattach as scratch3

session = scratch3.login("username", "password")
```

`login()` returns a `Session` object that saves your login

**Logging in with a sessionId:**
You can get your session id from your browser's cookies.

```python
import scratchattach as scratch3

session = scratch3.Session("sessionId", username="username") #The username argument is optional. You only have to put it if your IP address is blocked (for example if you are using replit)
```

**Attributes:**
```py
session.session_id #Returns the associated session id
session.xtoken
session.email #Returns the email address associated with the account
session.new_scratcher #Returns True if the associated account is a New Scratcher
session.mute_status
session.banned #Returns True if the associated account is banned
```

# Cloud variables  `scratch3.CloudConnection` `scratch3.TwCloudConnection`

**Connect to the Scratch cloud:**

With a `Session` object:

```python
conn = session.connect_cloud(project_id="project_id")
```

Directly with a sessionId (cookie connect):

```python
conn = scratch3.CloudConnection(project_id = "project_id", username="username", session_id="sessionId")
```

**Connect to the TurboWarp cloud:**

Does not require a session.

```python
conn = scratch3.TwCloudConnection(project_id = "project_id", username="username")  #optional argument: cloud_host="wss://clouddata.turbowarp.org"
```

**Set a cloud var:**

New Scratchers can set Scratch cloud variables too.

```python
conn.set_var("variable", "value") #the variable name is specified
without the cloud emoji
```

**Get a Scratch cloud var from the clouddata logs:**

Does not require a connection / session.

```python
value = scratch3.get_var("project_id", "variable")
variables = scratch3.get_cloud("project_id") #Returns a dict with all cloud var values
logs = scratch3.get_cloud_logs("project_id") #Returns the cloud logs as list
```

**Get a Scratch / TurboWarp cloud var from the websocket:** (new in v0.8.0)

Requires a connection to Scratch or TurboWarp's cloud (a `CloudConnection` / `TwCloudConnection` object).

```python
value = conn.get_var("variable")
```

# Encoding / Decoding  `scratch3.Encoding`

To send text to your Scratch project, you can use the built in encoder.
To decode sent texts in Scratch, download this sprite and add it to your Scratch project: https://scratch3-assets.1tim.repl.co/Encoder.sprite3

```python
from scratchattach import Encoding

Encoding.encode("input") #will return the encoded text
Encoding.decode("encoded") #will decode an encoded text
```

# Cloud events  `scratch3.CloudEvents` `scratch3.TwCloudEvents`

*Cloud events allow reacting to cloud events in real time. If a Scratcher
sets / creates / deletes a cloud var on the given project, an
event will be called.*

They do not require a session.

**How to use with Scratch:**

```python
import scratchattach as scratch3

events = scratch3.CloudEvents("project_id")

@events.event
def on_set(event): #Called when a cloud var is set
    print(f"{event.user} set the variable {event.var} to the valuee {event.value} at {event.timestamp}")

@events.event
def on_del(event):
    print(f"{event.user} deleted variable {event.var}")

@events.event
def on_create(event):
    print(f"{event.user} created variable {event.var}")

@events.event #Called when the event listener is ready
def on_ready():
   print("Event listener ready!")

events.start()
```

**How to use with TurboWarp:** (new in v0.4.7)

```python
import scratchattach as scratch3

events = scratch3.TwCloudEvents("project_id")

...
```

# Cloud requests  `scratch3.CloudRequests` `scratch3.TwCloudRequests`

*Cloud requests make it possible to access data like message counts, user
stats and  more from Scratch projects. They use cloud variables to
transmit data*

**Add Cloud requests to your Scratch project:**

Download this project file to your computer: https://scratch3-assets.1tim.repl.co/CloudRequests_Template.sb3

Then, go to the Scratch website, create a new project and upload the project file from above.

**How to use with Scratch:**

Copy this code to your Python editor:

```python
import scratchattach as scratch3

session = scratch3.login("username", "password") #replace with your data
conn = session.connect_cloud(project_id="project_id") #replace with your project id

client = scratch3.CloudRequests(conn) #optional argument: ignore_exceptions=True

@client.request
def ping(): #called when client receives request
    print("Ping request received")
    return "pong" #sends back 'pong' to the Scratch project

@client.event
def on_ready():
    print("Request handler is running")

client.run() #make sure this is ALWAYS at the bottom of your Python file
```

In the `Cloud Requests` sprite, you will find this block:

![image](https://scratch3-assets.1tim.repl.co/pypi_docs/tutorial.png/)

When active, it will send a "ping" request to the Python client. This will call the `ping()` function. The data returned by the function will be sent back to the project.

![image](https://scratch3-assets.1tim.repl.co/pypi_docs/tutorial_result.png/)

**More information:**

1)  **No length limitation** for the returned data! (If the response is too long to fit into one cloud var, it will be split to multiple cloud vars)
2)  It can handle multiple requests being sent at the same time
3)  You can freely choose the names of your requests
4)  You can also return lists

***More info can be found in the `Cloud Requests - Advanced` section at the bottom of this page!***

**Example 1: Script that loads your message count**

Scratch code:

![image](https://scratch3-assets.1tim.repl.co/pypi_docs/example1.png/)

Python code (add this to the code from above, but make sure `client.run()` stays at the bottom of the file):

```python
@client.request
def message_count(argument1):
    print(f"Message count requested for user {argument1}")
    user = scratch3.get_user(argument1)
    return user.message_count()
```

**Example 2: Script that loads someone's stats**

Scratch code:

![image](https://scratch3-assets.1tim.repl.co/pypi_docs/example3.png/)

Python code:

```python
@client.request
def foo(argument1):
    print(f"Data requested for user {argument1}")
    user = scratch3.get_user(argument1)
    stats = user.stats()

    return_data = []
    return_data.append(f"Total loves: {stats['loves']}")
    return_data.append(f"Total favorites: {stats['favorites']}")
    return_data.append(f"Total views: {stats['views']}")

    return return_data
```

**How to use with TurboWarp:** (new in v0.8.0)

```python
import scratchattach as scratch3

conn = scratch3.TwCloudConnection(project_id="project_id") #replace with your project id
client = scratch3.TwCloudRequests(conn) #optional argument: ignore_exceptions=True

@client.request
def ping(): #called when client receives request
    print("Ping request received")
    return "pong" #sends back 'pong' to the Scratch project

client.run() #make sure this is ALWAYS at the bottom of your Python file
```

**More information:**

1)  **No length limitation** for the returned data! (If the response is too long to fit into one cloud var, it will be split to multiple cloud vars)
2)  It can handle multiple requests being sent at the same time
3)  You can freely choose the names of your requests
4)  You can also return lists

```

# Backpack

```python
session.backpack(limit=20, offset=0) #Returns the contents of your backpack as dictionary
session.delete_from_backpack("asset id") #Deletes an asset from your backpack
```

# Cloud Requests - Advanced

**Get the request metadata:** (new in v0.8.4)

In your requests, you can use these functions:
```py
client.get_requester() #Returns the name of the user who sent the request
client.get_timestamp() #Returns the timestamp when the request was sent (in milliseconds since 1970)
```

**Run cloud requests in a thread:** (new in v0.9.4)

By default, this is not enabled. How to enable:
```py
client.run(thread=True)
```

If enabled, you can put code below the client.run function.

**Method used to get the cloud variables:** (new in v0.8.4)

By default, the cloud variables will be fetched from the cloud logs:
```py
client.run(data_from_websocket=False)
```

You can also get the cloud data directly from the websocket:
```py
client.run(data_from_websocket=True)
```
This will make the response time of your Python code slighty faster, but you will no longer be able to use the `client.get_requester()` function (it will return `None`).

**Change what "FROM_HOST_" cloud vars are used:** (new in v0.9.1)
```py
client = scratch3.CloudRequests(conn, used_cloud_vars=["1","2","3","4","5",...])
```
This allows you to set what "FROM_HOST_" cloud variables the Python script uses to send data back to your project. You can remove unused "FROM_HOST_" cloud variables from the Scratch project.

**Ignore exceptions:**

By default, the request handler will ignore exceptions occuring in your requests. You can also make it raise these exceptions instead:
```py
client = scratch3.CloudRequests(conn, ignore_exceptions=False)
```

**Send more than two arguments:**

The seperator used to join the different arguments is "&". To send more than three arguments from Scratch, join them using "&".

**Change packet length and clouddata log URL:**

Only change this if you know what you are doing.

```py
client = scratch3.CloudRequests(conn, _log_url="https://clouddata.scratch.mit.edu/logs", _packet_length=220)
```

# Cloud Requests - Events
(new in v0.9.1)

Will be called when specific things happen.

*Called after the client connected to the cloud:*
```py
@client.event
def on_ready():
    print("Request handler is ready")
```

*Called every time the client receives any request:*
```py
@client.event
def on_request(request):
    print("Received request", request.name, request.requester, request.arguments, request.timestamp, request.id)
```

*Called when the client receives an unknown / undefined request:*
```py
@client.event
def on_unknown_request(request):
    print("Received unknown request", request.name, request.requester, request.arguments, request.timestamp, request.id)
```

*Called when an error occurs in a request:*
```py
@client.event
def on_error(request, e):
    print("Request: ", request.name, request.requester, request.arguments, request.timestamp, request.id)
    print("Error that occured: ", e)
```
