    """
    The TopicStore class contains the root node of the topic graph.

    All topics can be mapped from the root node. The code to produce the graph
    is in the Topic module.

    The graph structure is used to store the parent/child relationships in
    topics. It allows for easy lookup and display of options.

    The root node is a dict. It looks like this:

        root = {
            constants.PARENT_KEY: ["parent"],
            constants.TOPIC_KEY: ["topic1"],
            "parent": { constants.TOPIC_KEY: ["topic2"] }
        }

    - constants.PARENT_KEY provides a list of all parents within the graph
    - constants.TOPIC_KEY provides all topics on the same level (in this case
      root)
    - every key afterwards is the parent and its value is a dict with the same
      structure relative to the same level (in this case root) except they will
      not have the PARENT_KEY

    self._topics is a flattened list of all topic objects in this store
