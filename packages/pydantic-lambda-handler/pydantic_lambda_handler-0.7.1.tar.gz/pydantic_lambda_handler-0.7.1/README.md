# Vision

Aim to create an easy-to-use decorator on a lambda for quick development of apis on AWS lambda using AWS Gateway.

Inspired by, and attempting to match the [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) api.

Currently, I'm working through the first steps to hit the basics.

This is very much at the beginning of the project, so I could do with all the help I can get :D

## MUST HAVE
* creates open api schema

API Gateway Lambda proxy integration
