# blette

A toolbox for edge detection tasks (binary and multi-label edges).

Currently only supports multi-label edge tasks on Cityscapes.
However, I'm working on using this toolbox for binary edge detection and adding support for various tasks and datasets.

## Installation

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# global package
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

- [Cityscapes](./.readme/cityscapes.md)
