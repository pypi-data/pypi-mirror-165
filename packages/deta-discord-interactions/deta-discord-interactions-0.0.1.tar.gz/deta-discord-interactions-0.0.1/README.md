# Deta-Discord-Interactions

This is a small web framework that lets you write Discord Application Commands using a decorator syntax similar to Flask's `@app.route()` or Discord.py's `@bot.command()`, specialized for usage in https://deta.sh

```
@discord.command()
def ping(ctx):
    "Respond with a friendly 'pong'!"
    return "Pong!"
```
