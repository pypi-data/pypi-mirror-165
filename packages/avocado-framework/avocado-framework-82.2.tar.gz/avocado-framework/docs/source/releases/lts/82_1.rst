========
82.1 LTS
========

The Avocado team is proud to present a minor release in the 82.0 LTS (Long Term Stability)
series, version 81.1 LTS, is now available!

LTS Release
===========

For more information on what a LTS release means, please read
:ref:`rfc-long-term-stability`.

Upgrading from 82.x to 82.1
===========================

Upgrading should be smooth, and there are no additional instructions
besides the steps on the installation method used.  For instance,
if using pip, it should be as simple as::

  $ pip install avocado-framework==82.1

To use the latest 82.x release, you can also always do::

  $ pip install avocado-framework<83.0

Changes from 82.0
=================

* The :mod:`avocado.utils.software_manager` RPM backend now properly
  uses the right type when checking the installed version of a
  package.

* The :mod:`avocado.utils.cpu` library now properly handles s390x z13
  family of CPUs.

* Build fixes for the RPM packages on Fedora 34 and newer, by not
  making use of ``make`` without an explicit requirement.

* A workaround for Travis-CI on arm64 (aarch64) was included, using
  only one CPU avoid job's processes being killed.
