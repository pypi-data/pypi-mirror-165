# A professional data app framework for Python and Jupyter

Build data apps like a pro for the Jupyter notebook and production.

## What it is?

Solara lets you use and build reusable UI components for data focussed web apps (data apps) that work in the Jupyter ecosystem and the production ready Solara-server.

Based on proven technologies and mature standards (ReactJS, NextJS, Jupyter, Jupyter-widgets, FastAPI, Flask, etc), Solara will allow your data apps to scale from a one-off experiment in the Jupyter notebook, to a highly dynamic data portal while keeping your code complexity under control.

We care about developer experience, from hot reloading to type hints and managing complexity.
