# MathCo
### Companion for your Mathematical operations

MathCo is a Python Basic Library that can perform basic mathematical functions and operations. Easy to use.

Install Mathco : `pip install mathco`<br>
MathCo Github : [Click this link](https://github.com/AbelR007/Mathco/)
Version Control : **`MathCo v0.3`**

## Why MathCo?
As "MathCo", the name itself means, "Maths Companion", a guide to help you out for whatever operation do you need it.
We're at a constant rate of combining all mathematical operations in one module for ease of access and performance.
We want to keep libraries simpler and easier to use. 

## Examples
- Simple Usage of Mathco Library
```python
from mathco import Basic
x = Basic() # Creates an instance
print(x.add(1,2)) # Gives out output as "3"
```
- Fibonacci Series
```python
from mathco import Fibonacci
x = Fibonacci()
print(x.series(5))
```
## Functions available
1. Basic()
   - `x.add(x,y)` : Adds two integers
   - `x.sub(x,y)` : Subtracts two integers
   - `x.mul(x,y)` : Multiply two integers
   - `x.div(x,y)` : Divides two integers
2. Fibonacci()
   - `x.series(n)`: Fibonacci Series ranging to "n"

## Extra Details

- **License :** GNU General Public License v3.0
- **Modules Needed :** None (for v0.0.3)
