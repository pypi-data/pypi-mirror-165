A very simple testing library intended for use by students in an intro
course. Includes capabilities for mocking input and setting up checks
for the results and/or printed output of arbitrary expressions. Also
includes basic AST checking tools (good for instructors to include in
test suites but probably tricky for students to author) and a
reverse tracing feature where comments specifying the evolution of
program state can be checked.

optimism.py

## Example usage

### Basic test cases

See `examples/basic.py` for an extended example file showing basic usage
of core functions. Here is a very short example:

>>> import optimism
>>> optimism.messagesAsErrors(False)
>>> optimism.colors(False)
>>> def f(x, y):
...     "Example function"
...     return x + y + 1
...
>>> # Simple test for that function
>>> tester = optimism.testFunction(f)
>>> case = tester.case(1, 2)
>>> case.checkReturnValue(4) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
✓ ...
True
>>> case.checkReturnValue(5) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
✗ ...
  Result:
    4
  was NOT equivalent to the expected value:
    5
  Called function 'f' with arguments:
    x = 1
    y = 2
False

For code in files, the filename and line number are shown instead of
stdin:1 as shown above. Note that line numbers reported for function
calls that span multiple lines may be different between Python versions
before 3.8 and versions 3.8+.


### Code Structure Checking

The `examples/code.py` file has a longer example of how to use the
AST-checking mechanisms for checking code structures. Here is a simple
one:

>>> import optimism
>>> def askNameAge():
...     "A function that uses input."
...     name = input("What is your name? ")
...     age = input("How old are you? ")
...     return (name, age)
...
>>> tester = optimism.testFunction(askNameAge)
>>> tester.checkCodeContains(optimism.Call('input')) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
✓ ...
True
>>> tester.checkCodeContains(optimism.Loop()) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
✗ ...
  Code does not contain the expected structure:
    at least 1 loop(s) or generator expression(s)
  checked code of function 'askNameAge'
False

The `TestManager.checkCodeContains` function and the various
code-structure classes (see `ASTRequirement`) can be used to ensure that
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code associated with a test manager
has certain structures.


### Reverse Tracing

Note: This functionality is planned, but not implemented yet.

The `examples/reverse_tracing.py` file contains more thorough examples of
this functionality. Here is a simple one:

>>> import optimism
>>> code = '''\\
... x = 5
... ## x = 5
... y = x + 3
... ## y=8
... print(x, '\\\\n', y)
... ## prints:
... ## '5 '
... ## ' 8'
... x, y = y, x
... ## x = 8, y = 5
... z = x + y
... # this last trace assertion is incorrect
... ## z = 14
... '''
>>> tester = optimism.testBlock(code)
>>> tester.validateTrace() # doctest: +SKIP +ELLIPSIS
✗ ...
  Trace assertions were not completely valid:
    First failing assertion was on line 13:
      z = 14
    The actual value of z was:
      13
False
>>> functionBlock = '''\\
... def f(x, y):
...     #: x = 3, y = 4
...     x += 1
...     ## x = 4
...     return x + y
...     ## returns: 8
...
... # These trace blocks replay the most-recently defined trace suite ('#:')
... # using different initial values.
... #> x = 1, y = 1
... ## x = 2
... ## returns: 3
...
... #> x=2, y=2
... ## x=3
... ## returns: 5
... '''
>>> tester2 = optimism.testBlock(functionBlock)
>>> tester2.validateTrace() # doctest: +SKIP +ELLIPSIS
✓ ...
True


## Core functionality

The main functions you'll need are:

- `trace` works like `print`, but shows some extra information, and you
  can use it as part of a larger expression. Use this for figuring out
  what's going wrong when your tests don't pass.
- `expect` takes two arguments and prints a check-mark if they're
  equivalent or an x if not. If they aren't equivalent, it prints
  details about values that are part of the first expression. Use this
  for expectations-based debugging.
- `expectType` works like `expect`, but the second argument is a type,
  and it checks whether the value of the first argument is an instance
  of that type or not. For more serious type-checking without having to
  run your program and without slowing it down when it does run, use MyPy
  or another actual type-checking system.
- `testFunction` establishes a test manager object, which can be used to
  create test cases. When you call `testFunction` you specify the
  function that you want to test. The `.case` method of the resulting
  `TestManager` object can be used to set up individual test cases. The
  `.checkCodeContains` method can be used to check for certain structural
  properties of the code of the function.
- `testFile` establishes a test manager object just like `testFunction`,
  but for running an entire file instead of for calling a single
  function.
- `testBlock` establishes a test manager object just like `testFunction`,
  but for running a block of code (given as a string).
- The `TestManager.case` method establishes a test case by specifying
  what arguments are going to be used with the associated function. It
  returns a `TestCase` object that can be used to establish
  expectations. For test managers based on files or blocks, no arguments
  are needed.
- The `TestCase.checkReturnValue`, `TestCase.checkVariableValue`,
  `TestCase.checkPrintedLines`, and/or `TestCase.checkCustom` methods can
  be used to run checks for the return value and/or printed output and/or
  variables defined by a test case.
- Normally, output printed during tests is hidden, but `showPrintedLines`
  can be used to show the text that's being captured instead.
- `TestCase.provideInputs` sets up inputs for a test case, so that
  interactive code can be tested without pausing for real user input.
- The `TestManager.checkCodeContains` method can be used to check the
  abstract syntax tree of of the function, file or block associated with
  a test manager. The argument must be an instance of the
  `ASTRequirement` class, which has multiple sub-classes for checking for
  the presence of various different code constructs.
- The `TestManager.validateTrace` method can be used to check trace
  assertion comments within the code of a function, file, or code block.
  **TODO: This function is not implemented yet.**
- `detailLevel` can be called to control the level of detail printed in
  the output. It affects all tracing, expectation, and testing output
  produced until it gets called again.
- `showSummary` can be used to summarize the number of checks which
  passed or failed.
- `colors` can be used to enable or disable color codes for printed text.
  Disable this if you're getting garbled printed output.

TODO: Workaround for tracing in interactive console?

## Changelog

- Version 2.7.5 allows the code value for a function test manager to be
  `None` when the code for the function cannot be found using
  `inspect.getsource`, instead of letting the associated `OSError`
  bubble out.
- Version 2.7.4 flips this changelog right-side-up (i.e., newest-first).
  Also introduces the `code` slot for `TestManager` objects, so that
  they store raw code in addition to a derived syntax tree. This change
  also means that `BlockManager` objects no longer store their code in
  the `target` slot, which is now just a fixed string. It also changes
  `listAllCases` to `listAllTrials` and changes 'cases' to 'trials' in a
  few other places since code checks are not associated with test cases
  but are trials. Common functionality is moved to the `Trial` class.
- Version 2.7.3 introduces the `mark` function, and removes
  `testCodeWithSuite`, adding `testMarkedCode` instead. This helps
  prevent suites (previously required for marking code blocks) from being
  started when you need another suite to be active.
- Version 2.7.2 introduces `listOutcomesInSuite` and registers outcomes
  from `expect` and `expectType` calls. These will also be included in
  `showSummary` results. It renames `startTestSuite` to just `testSuite`,
  and introduces `freshTestSuite` which deletes any old results instead
  of extending them.
- Version 2.7.1 sets the `SKIP_ON_FAILURE` back to `None`, since default
  skipping is a potential issue for automated test reporting. It adds
  `SUPPRESS_ON_FAILURE` to compensate for this and enables it by default,
  suppressing error details from checks after one failure per manager. It
  also adds `checkVariableValue` for checking the values of variables set
  in files or code blocks (it does not work on function tests).
- Version 2.7 introduces the `ASTRequirement` class and subclasses, along
  with the `TestManager.checkCodeContains` method for applying them. It
  reorganizes things a bit so that `Trial` is now a super-class of both
  `TestCase` and the new `CodeChecks` class.
- Version 2.6.7 changes default SKIP_ON_FAILURE back to 'case', since
  'all' makes interactive testing hard, and dedicated test files can call
  skipChecksAfterFail at the top. Also fixes an issue where comparing
  printed output correctly is lenient about the presence or absence of a
  final newline, but comparing file contents didn't do that. This change
  means that extra blank lines (including lines with whitespace on them)
  are ignored when comparing strings and IGNORE_TRAILING_WHITESPACE is
  on, and even when IGNORE_TRAILING_WHITESPACE is off, the presence or
  absence of a final newline in a file or in printed output will be
  copied over to a multi-line expectation (since otherwise there's no way
  to specify the lack of a final newline when giving multiple string
  arguments to `checkPrintedLines` or `checkFileLines`).
- Version 2.6.6 changes from splitlines to split('\\n') in a few places
  because the latter is more robust to extra carriage returns. This
  changes how some error messages look and it means that in some places
  the newline at the end of a file actually counts as having a blank line
  there in terms of output (behavior is mostly unchanged). Also escaped
  carriage returns in displayed strings so they're more visible. From
  this version we do NOT support files that use just '\\r' as a newline
  as easily. But `IGNORE_TRAILING_WHITESPACE` will properly get rid of
  any extra '\\r' before a newline, so when that's on (the default) this
  shouldn't change much. A test of this behavior was added to the file
  test example.
- Version 2.6.5 fixes a bug with displaying filenames when a file does
  not exist and `checkFileLines` is used, and also sets the default
  length higher for printing first differing lines in
  `findFirstDifference` since those lines are displayed on their own line
  anyways. Fixes a bug where list differences were not displayed
  correctly, and improves the usefulness of first differences displayed
  for dictionaries w/ different lengths. Also fixes a bug where strings
  which were equivalent modulo trailing whitespace would not be treated
  as equivalent.
- Version 2.6.4 immediately changes `checkFileContainsLines` to
  `checkFileLines` to avoid confusion about whether we're checking
  against the whole file (we are).
- Version 2.6.3 introduces the `checkFileContainsLines` method, and also
  standardizes the difference-finding code and merges it with
  equality-checking code, removing `checkEquality` and introducing
  `findFirstDifference` instead (`compare`) remains but just calls
  `findFirstDifference` internally. Also fixes a bug w/ printing
  tracebacks for come checkers (need to standardize that!). Also adds
  global skip-on-failure and sets that as the default!
- Version 2.6.2 fixes a bug with dictionary comparison which caused a
  crash when key sets weren't equal. It also adds unit tests for the
  `compare` function.
- Version 2.4.0 adds a more object-oriented structure behind the scenes,
  without changing any core API functions. It also adds support for
  variable specifications in block tests.
- Version 2.3.0 adds `testFunctionMaybe` for skippable tests if the
  target function hasn't been defined yet.
- Version 2.2.0 changed the names of `checkResult` and `checkOutputLines`
  to `checkReturnValue` and `checkPrintedLines`
- Version 2.0 introduced the `TestManager` and `TestCase` classes, and
  got rid of automatic tracking for test cases. The old test case
  functionality was moved over to the `expect` function. This helps make
  tests more stable and makes meta-reasoning easier.

    Establishes an immediate expectation that the values of the two

    if the expectation is not met, and either way a message indicating
    success or failure will be printed. Use `detailLevel` to control how
    detailed the messages are.

    For `expect` to work properly, the following rules must be followed:

    1. When multiple calls to `expect` appear on a single line of the
        source code (something you should probably avoid anyway), none of
        the calls should execute more times than another when that line
        is executed (it's difficult to violate this, but examples
        include the use of `expect` multiple times on one line within
        generator or if/else expressions)
    2. None of the following components of the expression passed to
        `expect` should have side effects when evaluated:
        - Attribute accesses
        - Subscripts (including expressions inside brackets)
        - Variable lookups
        (Note that those things don't normally have side effects!)

    This function returns True if the expectation is met and False
    otherwise. It returns None if the check is skipped, which will
    happen when `SKIP_ON_FAILURE` is `'all'` and a previous check failed.
    If the values are not equivalent, this will count as a failed check
    and other checks may be skipped.
