# This is not yet used by any backend tool, but we comply with PEP 621 and PEP 631 anyway. For now,
# setup.py reads the metadata from this file and passes it to skbuild.setup(). It makes several
# assumptions about the structure of the "project" table that are not required by PEP 621.
# After any substantial changes to this table, even if they conform to PEP 621, setup.py should
# therefore be checked to ensure the data is still parsed correctly.
