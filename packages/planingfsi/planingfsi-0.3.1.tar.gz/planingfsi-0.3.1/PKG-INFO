PlaningFSI is a scientific Python program use to calculate the steady-state response of two-dimensional marine structures planing at constant speed on the free surface with consideration for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) and rigid body motion.
It was originally written in 2012-2013 to support my Ph.D. research and has recently (2018) been updated and released as open-source.

## Cautionary Note

I am currently working on releasing this package as open source.
Since this is my first open-source release, the next few releases on PyPI should not be used for production.
I will release version 1.0.0 and remove this note once I feel that I have sufficiently cleaned up and documented the code.

## Required Python version

The code is written in Python and was originally written in Python 2.6.5.
it has since been updated to require Python 3.6+.

## Installation

PlaningFSI can be installed with pip:

```
pip install planingfsi
```

## Contributing

To contribute, you should install the code in developer mode.

```
poetry install --develop=.
```

## Getting Started

The main command-line interface is called `planingFSI` and can be called directly, once appropriate input files have been prepared.
A collection of examples can be found in the `tutorials` directory in the source package.
