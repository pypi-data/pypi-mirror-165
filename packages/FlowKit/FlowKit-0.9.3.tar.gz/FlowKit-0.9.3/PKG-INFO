## Overview

FlowKit is an intuitive Python toolkit for flow cytometry analysis and visualization, with full support for the [GatingML 2.0 standard](http://flowcyt.sourceforge.net/gating/latest.pdf) and limited support for FlowJo 10 workspace files.

## Features

> **NOTE**: Version 0.6 added experimental support for exporting FlowJo 10 workspace files from a Session. Support is currently limited to exporting data from a single sample group. Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit/issues/new/choose) if you find any bugs related to this feature.

* Read / Write FCS Files
  * Read FCS files, supporting FCS versions 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1
  * Export FCS data as:
    * A new FCS 3.1 file
    * NumPy array
    * Pandas DataFrame
    * CSV text file
* Compensation
  * Compensate events using spillover matrices from:
    * $SPILL or $SPILLOVER keyword value
    * FlowJo tab-delimited text
    * NumPy array
    * GatingML 2.0 spectrumMatrix XML element
  * Create a compensation matrix from a set of compensation bead files
* Transformation
  * Logicle
  * Inverse hyperbolic sine (ArcSinh)
  * FlowJo Bi-exponential
  * Hyperlog
  * Logarithmic
  * Channel ratios
  * Linear
* Gating
  * Full support for the GatingML 2.0 specification
    * Import GatingML XML documents as gating strategies
    * Export gating strategies as a valid GatingML XML document
  * Limited support for importing FlowJo 10 workspace files. Workspace files are currently limited to the following features:
    * Linear, logarithmic, bi-exponential, and logicle transforms
    * Polygon, rectangle, ellipse, and quadrant gates
    * Export a Session's sample group analysis as a FlowJo 10 workspace file
  * Programmatically create gating strategies including polygon, rectangle, range, ellipsoid, quadrant, and boolean gates
  * Retrieve gating results as a Pandas DataFrame 
* Visualization
  * Histogram of single channel data
  * Contour density plot of two channels
  * Interactive scatter plot of two channels
  * Interactive scatter plot matrix of any combination of channels
  * Interactive scatter plots of gates with sample events

## Requirements

FlowKit supports Python version 3.7 or above. All dependencies are installable 
via pip, and are listed below.

> **NOTE**: FlowUtils uses C extensions for significant performance improvements. For most platforms and Python versions, pre-built binaries are available in PyPI (i.e. installable via `pip`). 
>
> If a pre-built binary of FlowUtils is not available for your environment, the C extensions must be compiled using the source package. NumPy >=1.19 must be installed prior to compiling FlowUtils. If compiling using `gcc`, version 5 or later is required.

Required Python dependencies:

* [flowio](https://github.com/whitews/flowio) == 1.0.1
* [flowutils](https://github.com/whitews/flowutils) == 1.0.0
* anytree >= 2.6
* bokeh >= 2, <3.0
* lxml >= 4.4
* matplotlib >= 3.1
* networkx >= 2.3
* numpy >= 1.20
* pandas >= 1.1
* psutils >= 5.8
* scipy >= 1.3
* seaborn >= 0.11
* statsmodels

## Installation

> **NOTE**: For macOS users running on Apple Silicon, the version of `pip` may need to be upgraded prior to installing FlowKit in order to install the required dependencies.

### From PyPI

```
pip install flowkit
```

### From source

Clone the repository and ensure `pip` is up-to-date. It is recommended to use `pip` to install requirements as relying on `setuptools` may result in incompatible dependency versions.

```
git clone https://github.com/whitews/flowkit
cd flowkit
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Documentation

The FlowKit API documentation is available [on ReadTheDocs here](https://flowkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). The tutorial notebooks in the `docs/notebooks` directory are a great place to get started with FlowKit, and are linked below.
If you have any questions about FlowKit, find any bugs, or feel something is missing from the tutorials below [please submit an issue to the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit/issues/new/).
