```python
import asyncio
from tesla_wall_connector import WallConnector
async def main():
    async with WallConnector('TeslaWallConnector_ABC123.localdomain') as wall_connector:
        lifetime = await wall_connector.async_get_lifetime()
        print("energy_wh: {}Wh".format(lifetime.energy_wh))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager.

You need at least:

- Python 3.8+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

To install all packages, including all development requirements:
