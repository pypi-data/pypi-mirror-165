```terminal
sudo pip3 install tuifimanager --upgrade
```
```terminal
pip3 install TUIFIManager --upgrade
```

## Usage
Run `tuifi` in your terminal to use it as is or import it in one of your [Uni-Curses](https://github.com/unicurses/unicurses) project as a component like:
```python
from TUIFIManager import *
```
