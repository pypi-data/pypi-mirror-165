# Pioreactor relay plugin

This relay plugin allows the user to turn on or off any add-on piece on their Pioreactor at a specific channel (as stated in the Configuration).

When installed, under _Manage_, there will be a new _Activities_ option called _Relay_. Editable settings include _Set relay on_, where 1 would turn the function on, and 0 will turn it off. 

## Installation instructions 

Install from the Pioreactor plugins web interface or the command line. 

```
pio install-plugin pioreactor-relay-plugin
```
