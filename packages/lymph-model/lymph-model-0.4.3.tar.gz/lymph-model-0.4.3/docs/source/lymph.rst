Detailed API
============

The human lymph system (or rather parts of it) are modelled as directed graphs here. Hence, a :class:`System` consists of multiple :class:`Node` and :class:`Edge` instances, which are represented by a python class each.

Recently, we added the convenience class :class:`BilateralSystem` that automatically creates a symmetric graph for the ipsilateral and contralateral network. It also allows to fix sperad parameters to be set symmetrically.

Edge
----

Represents a lymphatic drainage pathway and therefore are spread probability. It is represented by the simplest possible class suitable for the task.

.. autoclass:: lymph.Edge
   :members:

Node
----

Represents a lymph node level (LNL) or rather a random variable associated with it. It encodes the microscopic involvement of the LNL and - if involved - might spread along outgoing edges.
