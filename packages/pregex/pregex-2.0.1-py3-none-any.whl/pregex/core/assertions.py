All classes within this module "assert" something about the provided pattern
without having to match any additional characters. For example, :class:`MatchAtStart`
ensures that the provided pattern matches only when it is found at the start of the string,
while :class:`NotFollowedBy` asserts that a match must not be followed by one or more
specified patterns. Another thing you should keep in mind is that some of these assertions
cannot be quantified, as attempting that will cause a ``CannotBeQuantifiedException`` exception
to be thrown. The only exception to this is quantifier :class:`~pregex.quantifiers.Optional`,
which can be applied to every assertion as it does not result in the pattern having to be
repeated more than once.
