This module contains three classes, namely :class:`Concat`, :class:`Enclose`,
and :class:`Either`, the first two of which are used to concatenate two or more patterns
together, whereas the last one constitutes the alternation operator, which is used to
indicate that either one of the provided patterns constitutes a valid match.

Classes & methods

Below are listed all classes within :py:mod:`pregex.core.operators`
along with any possible methods they may possess.
