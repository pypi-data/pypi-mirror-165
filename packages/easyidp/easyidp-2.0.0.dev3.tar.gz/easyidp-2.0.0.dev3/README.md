EasyIDP (Easy Intermediate Data Processor), A handy tool for dealing with region of interest (ROI) on the image reconstruction (Metashape & Pix4D) outputs, mainly in agriculture applications. It provides the following functions: 

1. Backward Projection ROI to original images (`Backward Projector`).
2. Crop ROI on GeoTiff Maps (DOM & DSM) and Point Cloud (`ROI Cropper`).
3. Save cropped results to corresponding files (`ROI Saver`).

This project tried to use packges based on pure-python, instead of installing some heavy packages (Open3D, OpenCV) and hard to install packages (GDAL dependices) for one or two individual functions. This may cause efficiency loss and differences in coding habit.

## <div align="center">Documentation</div>

Please check [Official Documents](https://easyidp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for full documentations. And please also use the [Github Discussion](https://github.com/UTokyo-FieldPhenomics-Lab/EasyIDP/discussions) when you meet any problems.


## <div align="center">Quick Start Examples (Processing)</div>

You can install the packages by PyPi:

```bash
pip install easyidp
```

And import the packages in your python code:

```python
import easyidp as idp
```

---

Before doing the following example, please understand the basic pipeline for image 3D reconstruction by Pix4D or Metashape. And know how to export the DOM, DSM (\*.tiff), and Point cloud (\*.ply). Also require some basic knowledge about GIS shapefile format (\*.shp).

> Please note, if you see this sentence, it means the following examples are not suppported yet.

<summary>1. Read ROI</summary>

```python
roi = idp.ROI("xxxx.shp")  # lon and lat 2D info
  
# get z values from DSM
roi.get_z_from_dsm("xxxx_dsm.tiff")  # add height 3D info
```

The 2D roi can be used to crop the DOM, DSM, and point cloud (`2.crop by ROI`). While the 3D roi can be used for Backward projection (`4. Backward projection`)

<summary>2. Crop by ROI</summary>

Read the DOM and DSM Geotiff Maps
```python
dom = idp.GeoTiff("xxx_dom.tif")
dsm = idp.GeoTiff("xxx_dsm.tif")
```
  
Read point cloud data
```python
ply = idp.PointCloud("xxx_pcd.ply")
```
  
crop the region of interest from ROI:
```python
dom_parts = roi.crop(dom)
dsm_parts = roi.crop(dsm)
pcd_parts = roi.crop(ply)
```

If you want to save these crops to given folder:
```python
dom_parts = roi.crop(dom, save_folder="./crop_dom")
dsm_parts = roi.crop(dsm, save_folder="./crop_dsm")
pcd_parts = roi.crop(ply, save_folder="./crop_pcd")
```

  
</details>

<details close>
<summary>3. Read Reconstruction projects</summary>

Add the reconstruction projects to processing pools (different flight time for the same field):
  
```python
proj = idp.ProjectPool()
proj.add_pix4d(["date1.p4d", "date2.p4d", ...])
proj.add_metashape(["date1.psx", "date2.psx", ...])
```

Then you can specify each chunk by:

```python
p1 = proj[0]
# or
p1 = proj["chunk_or_project_name"]
```

</details>

<details close>
<summary>4. Backward Projection</summary>
  
```python
>>> img_dict = roi.back2raw(chunk1)
```
  
Then check the results:
```python
# find the raw image name list
>>> img_dict.keys()   
dict_keys(['DJI_0177.JPG', 'DJI_0178.JPG', 'DJI_0179.JPG', 'DJI_0180.JPG', ... ]

# the roi pixel coordinate on that image
>>> img_dict['DJI_0177.JPG'] 
array([[ 779,  902],
       [1043,  846],
       [1099, 1110],
       [ 834, 1166],
       [ 779,  902]])
```

Save backward projected images

```python
img_dict = roi.back2raw(chunk1, save_folder="folder/to/put/results/")
```
