-------
Install
-------

.. code-block::

    pip install ducks

-----
Usage
-----

The main container in ducks is called Dex.

.. code-block::

    from ducks import Dex

    # make some objects
    objects = [
        {'x': 3, 'y': 'a'},
        {'x': 6, 'y': 'b'},
        {'x': 9, 'y': 'c'}
    ]

    # Create a Dex containing the objects.
    # Index on x and y.
    dex = Dex(objects, ['x', 'y'])

    # match objects
    dex[{
        'x': {'>': 5, '<': 10},  # where 5 < x < 10
        'y': {'in': ['a', 'b']}  # and y is 'a' or 'b'
    }]
    # result: [{'x': 6, 'y': 'b'}]

This is a Dex of dicts, but the objects can be any type.

Dex supports ==, !=, in, not in, <, <=, >, >=.

The indexes can be dict keys, object attributes, or custom functions.

------------
Is Dex fast?
------------

Yes. Here's how Dex compares to other object-finders on an example task.

`Benchmark source <https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/perf_demo.ipynb>`_

The closest thing to a Dex is an in-memory SQLite. While SQLite is a fantastic database, it requires
more overhead. As such, Dex is generally faster.
