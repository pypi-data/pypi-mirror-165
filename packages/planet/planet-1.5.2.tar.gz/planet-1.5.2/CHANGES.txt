1.5.2 (2022-09-01)

- Require requests-futures<1.0 as in version 1.4.9. Version 1.0.0 of
  requests-futures breaks order downloads for an unknown reason.

1.5.1 (2022-07-28)

- Fix: execution of the v1 CLI now prints a more clear, yellow colored warning
  message aimed at CLI users. A more detailed version of the same warning is
  also printed in the planet commands usage message (#652).
- Fix: the deprecation warning emitted on import of planet.api now uses
  stacklevel=2 and thus points at the module which imports planet.api (#652).

1.5.0 (2022-06-29)

Work on new features for version 1 of this software has ceased. Version 2 is
under development and the final 2.0.0 release is expected at the end of 2022.
There will not be a 1.6.0 release. Releases in the 1.5.x series will be made
to fix major bugs on a quarterly cadence. There may be one such bug fix
release for version 1 after 2.0.0 is released, but probably not more. Packages
for planet versions < 2 will remain on the Python Package Index indefinitely. 

Version 2 will be packaged as "planet" and its command line programs will also
use the name "planet". Thus it will replace version 1. Version 2 will not be
backwards compatible with version 1. That is to say that applications which
depend on version 1 will not work with version 2. This goes for the command
line programs as well. Version 2's "planet orders", for example, has usage
changes that will likely have impact on scripts written for version 1.

Users of version 1 who do not wish to upgrade to version 2 should ensure that
their project requirements specify "planet<2", because when 2.0.0 is published
to the Python Package Index "pip install planet" (for example) will download
and install 2.0.0.

A 2.0a1 pre-release is available now on PyPI. The Python package installer pip
requires that you opt in to pre-releases by executing
"pip install --pre planet" or be specifying the pre-release version precisely
as in "pip install planet==2.0a1".

All that said, we want migration to 2.0.0 to be a win for users. Early
feedback on the new Python API and CLI are critical to making it so. How can
we support your existing workflows and systems while providing new features
and more powerful abstractions? Please send the Planet Dev Rel email at
developers@planet.com or join the project discussions at
https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python/discussions. You can have a
say on what 2.0.0 looks like. We're eager to hear from you.

Importing the planet.api module from version 1.5.x will result in a warning
about the removal of planet.api in version 2.0.0. Running any command line
program from version 1.5.x will show the same warning.
