    Delete a list of runs in the MosaicML Cloud. Any runs that are currently running will
    first be stopped.

    Args:
        runs (``Optional[List[str] | List[``:class:`~mcli.api.model.run.Run` ``]]``):
            A list of runs or run names to delete. Using :class:`~mcli.api.model.run.Run`
            objects is most efficient. See the note below.
        timeout (``Optional[float]``): Time, in seconds, in which the call should complete.
            If the call takes too long, a :exc:`~concurrent.futures.TimeoutError`
            will be raised. If ``future`` is ``True``, this value will be ignored.
        future (``bool``): Return the output as a :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future`. If True, the
            call to :func:`delete_runs` will return immediately and the request will be
            processed in the background. This takes precedence over the ``timeout``
            argument. To get the list of :class:`~mcli.api.model.run.Run` output,
            use ``return_value.result()`` with an optional ``timeout`` argument.

    Returns:
        If future is False:
            A list of deleted :class:`~mcli.api.model.run.Run` objects
        Otherwise:
            A :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` for the list

    Note:
        The Kubernetes API requires the platform for each run. If you provide ``runs`` as a
        list of names, we will get this by calling :func:`~mcli.sdk.get_runs`. Since
        a common way to get the list of runs is to have already called
        :func:`~mcli.sdk.get_runs`, you can avoid a second call by passing
        the output of that call in directly.
