## What is grappler?

Grappler is a set of tools for loading plugins into a Python
application. With it, you can load third-party plugins which
advertise along specific topics, and perform additional filtering
according to the tools provided with the library. Furthermore,
Grappler is compatible with typed Python out of the box.

## Feature highlights

- [Extremely simple interface](https://mr-rodgers.github.io/grappler/#quick-start)
  for loading entry-points out of the box.
- Extensible design, allowing implementation of new plugin sources with the
  [Grappler interface](https://mr-rodgers.github.io/grappler/api/core/#grappler.Grappler)
- [Composable API](https://mr-rodgers.github.io/grappler/user-guide/#customising-loading-with-grapplers)
  for customizing plugin sources and loading behaviour
- [Handy built-in tools](https://mr-rodgers.github.io/grappler/api/grapplers/)
  to help with customising loading behavior (e.g. blacklisting plugins so that
  their code is never loaded).
