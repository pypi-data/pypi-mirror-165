## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

To run ML workflows, your local machine is often not enough, so you need a way 
to automate running these workflows using the cloud infrastructure.

Instead of managing infrastructure yourself, writing custom scripts, or using cumbersome MLOps platforms, 
define your workflows in code and run from command-line.

dstack is an alternative to KubeFlow, SageMaker, Docker, SSH, custom scripts, and many other tools used often for
running ML workflows.

### Primary features of dstack:

1. **Infrastructure as code:** Define workflows and infrastructure requirements declaratively as code.
   dstack sets up and tears down infrastructure automatically.
2. **GitOps approach:** dstack is integrated with Git and tracks code automatically.
   No need to push local changes before running a workflow.
3. **Artifacts and tags:** Artifacts are the first-class citizens.
   Once the workflow is finished, assign a tag to it and reuse artifacts in other workflows.
4. **Environment setup:** No need to build own Docker images or setup CUDA yourself. Just specify Conda 
   requirements and they will be pre-configured.
5. **Interrupted workflows:** Artifacts can be stored in real-time, so you can fully-leverage spot/preemptive instances.
   Resume workflows from where they were interrupted.
6. **Technology-agnostic:** No need to use specific APIs in your code. Anything that works locally, can run via dstack.
7. **Dev environments:** Workflows may be not only tasks or applications but also dev environments, such as VS Code, JupyterLab, and Jupyter notebooks.
8. **Very easy setup:** Just install the dstack CLI and run workflows
   in your cloud using your local credentials. The state is stored in your cloud storage. 
   No need to set up any complicated software.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To use dstack, you'll only need the dstack CLI. No other software needs to be installed or deployed.

The CLI will use your local cloud credentials (e.g. the default AWS environment variables 
or the credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`.)

In order to install the CLI, you need to use pip:

```shell
pip install dstack
```

Before you can use dstack, you have to configure the dstack backend:

 * In which S3 bucket to store the state and the artifacts
 * In what region, create cloud instances.

To configure this, run the following command:

```shell
dstack config
Configure AWS backend:

AWS profile name (default):
S3 bucket name:
Region name:
```

The configuration will be stored in `~/.dstack/config.yaml`.

That's it. Now you can use dstack on your machine.

## âœ¨ Usage

### Define workflows

Workflows can be defined in the `.dstack/workflows.yaml` file within your 
project.

For every workflow, you can specify the provider, dependencies, commands, what output 
folders to store as artifacts, and what resources the instance would need (e.g. whether it should be a 
spot/preemptive instance, how much memory, GPU, etc.)

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "train"
    provider: bash
    deps:
      - tag: some_tag
    python: 3.10
    env:
      - PYTHONPATH=src
    commands:
      - pip install requirements.txt
      - python src/train.py
    artifacts: 
      - path: checkpoint
    resources:
      interruptible: true
      gpu: 1
```

### Run workflows

Once you run the workflow, dstack will create the required cloud instance(s) within a minute,
and will run your workflow. You'll see the output in real-time as your 
workflow is running.

```shell
$ dstack run train

Provisioning... It may take up to a minute. âœ“

To interrupt, press Ctrl+C.

...
```

[//]: # (If you want, you can run a workflow without defining it in `.dstack/workfows.yaml`:)

[//]: # (```shell)
[//]: # ($ dstack run bash -c "pip install requirements.txt && python src/train.py" \)
[//]: # (  -d :some_tag -a checkpoint -i --gpu 1)

[//]: # (Provisioning... It may take up to a minute. âœ“)

[//]: # (To interrupt, press Ctrl+C.)

[//]: # (...)
[//]: # (```)

### Manage tags

Tags help managing data. You can assign tags to finished workflows to reuse their output artifacts 
in other workflows. Another way to use tags is to upload data to dstack from your local machine
and assign n tag to it to use this data in workflows.

Here's how to assign a tag to a finished workflow:

```shell
dstack tags add TAG --run-name RUN
```

Here, `TAG` is the name of the tag and `RUN` is the name of the finished workflow run.

If you want to data from your local machine and save it as a tag to use it from other workflows,
here's how to do it:

```shell
dstack tags add TAG --local-dir LOCAL_DIR
```

Once a tag is created, you can refer to it from workflows, e.g. from `.dstack/workflows.yaml`:

```yaml
deps:
  - tag: some_tag
```

### Manage artifacts

The artifacts command allows you to browse or download the contents of artifacts.

Here's how to browse artifacts:

```shell
dstack artifacts list (RUN | :TAG)
```

Here's how to download artifacts:

```shell
dstack artifacts download (RUN | :TAG) [OUTPUT_DIR]
```

## Providers
