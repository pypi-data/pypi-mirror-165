## Installation

```shell
pip install pyZFC
```

## Introduction and examples

``NaturalNumber`` is the class of natural numbers defined
as von Neumann ordinals in the ZFC set theory.

0 is defined as the empty set ``{}``,
and the rest of the natural numbers
are defined recursively as ``n + 1 = n âˆª {n}``,
i.e.,

```math
0 = {},
1 = {0},
2 = {0, 1},
3 = {0, 1, 2},
...
```

Following the definition, you can do all kinds of
set operations on natural numbers, e.g., checking
whether a ``NaturalNumber`` contains another.

```Python console
>>> from zfc import NaturalNumber

>>> NaturalNumber(1) in NaturalNumber(2)
True

>>> NaturalNumber(1) & NaturalNumber(2)
1  # the intersection of 1={0} and 2={0,1} is {0}, which is exactly 1.
```
