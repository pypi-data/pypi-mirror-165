TintX is an adaptation of the tint (tracking algorithm)[https://github.com/openradar/TINT].
Tint and TintX are easy-to-use storm cell tracking package based on the
TITAN methodology by Dixon and Wiener. While Tint is meant to be applied to
radar data using the [py-ART toolkit](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) tintX can
be applied with any data - for example output from numerical weather prediction
models. The original tracking algorithm that has been developed by a team of
researchers at Monash University [Raut et al. 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0119.1).

## Installation
To install the packages run :
```bash
$: python -m pip install tintx
```
if you don't have root access add the ```--user``` flag for a local installation

## Usage
Documentation can be found on the official document page of this library.
