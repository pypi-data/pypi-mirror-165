I got tired of manually writing dictionaries to send embeds via Discord webhooks, so I made this package to do it effortlessly.

This package was developed on Python 3.10.x but has not been tested on earlier versions. If you happen to successfully use this package on an older version then do let me know.

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install embed-builder
```

## Usage

```python
from embed_builder import Embed

embed = Embed()
embed.set_title("Hello")
embed.set_description("How are you?")
my_embed = embed.build()

# Or via chaining...

my_embed = Embed().set_title("Hello").set_description("How are you?").build()

# Example usage with Discord webhooks and requests package

requests.post("webhook url", json={
    "content": "here is an embed",
    "embeds": [my_embed]
})
```

> **Warning**
> Discord's embed total character limit is not currently enforced through this package. Make sure your content is the correct size as you are building embeds.
