# What is `dbip`?



dbip is a library for IP authentication in Python that focuses on authentication security. It builds algorithms written in pure Python and can be ported to other languages.







## **`dbip` infrastructure**



```shell

dbip			# library name

│ __init__.py	# function table

└─ dbip.py		# system call table

````







## **`dbip` function usage method**







```shell

File function: IP database that supports IPv6 and IPv4 dual-stack protocols.

File Description: Add, delete, verify IP information

				dbip.update(ip)

				dbip.remove(ip)

				dbip.verify(ip)

				dbip.printf()

```







# Why use `dbip`?



`dbip` development principles:



1. **Security**: `dbip` (used with `websockets`) is used as authentication, the transmitted data can be in plain text and illegal users can only view it and cannot change it;

2. **Defense**: `dbip` (used in conjunction with `websockets`) will form an almost absolute elimination of all illegal user connections and brute force cracking;

3. **Performance**: `dbip` (used with `websockets`) will reduce the performance consumption of the server authentication process and greatly improve the resource allocation of productivity.







# Why not use `dbip`?



- If you often use web-provided libraries or have your own set of authentication methods, you can deprecate the library functions provided by `dbip`.
