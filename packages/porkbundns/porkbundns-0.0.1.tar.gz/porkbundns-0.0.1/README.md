# NOTICE

This package is not endorsed, related or developed by Porkbun. No relationship between the developers of this package and Porkbun exists, beyond Ivan being a Porkbun customer and writing this package to make his life easier. Don't go knock on their door if you have any questions, bugs or screw up your DNS config! (Also, please report bugs and ask questions, but don't knock on my door either. This is a very small project that I developed in my spare time.)
