Package Names and Versions
==========================

.. note::
   Valid characters are displayed as a regular expression, so that they
   can be concisely specified while still being exhaustive. Brackets (``[]``)
   are part of the regex and are not considered valid characters in any context.

Category Names
--------------

A category name may contain any of the characters ``[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]``.
It must not begin with a hyphen, a dot or a plus sign.

For consistency, the :ref:`Naming Guidelines <guidelines-naming>` for
packages should also be followed for categories.

Package Names
-------------

A package name may contain any of the characters ``[A-Za-z0-9+_-]``.
It must not begin with a hyphen or a plus sign, and must not end in a
hyphen followed by anything matching the :ref:`version-syntax`.

Also see :ref:`Naming Guidelines <guidelines-naming>`.

.. note::
   A package name does not include the category.
   The term qualified package name is used where a category/package pair is meant.

USE flag names
--------------
A USE flag name may contain any of the characters ``[A-Za-z0-9+_-]``.
It must begin with an alphanumeric character.

Underscores should be considered reserved for USE_EXPAND, as described
in the :ref:`use-expand` section of the USE flag guide.

Repository Names
----------------
A repository name may contain any of the characters ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]``.
It must not begin with a hyphen.
In addition, every repository name must also be a valid package name.

License Names
-------------

A license name may contain any of the characters ``[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]``.
It must not begin with a hyphen, a dot or a plus sign.

Keyword names
-------------

A keyword name may contain any of the characters ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]``.
It must not begin with a hyphen.
In contexts where it makes sense to do so, a keyword name may be prefixed by a tilde or a hyphen.
In :py:attr:`pybuild.Pybuild2.KEYWORDS`, -* is also acceptable as a keyword.

.. _version-syntax:

Version Syntax
--------------

A version starts with the number part, which is in the form ``[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*`` (an unsigned integer, followed by zero or more dot-prefixed unsigned integers). E.g. ``1.2.3``

This may optionally be followed by one of ``[a-z]`` (a lowercase letter).

This may be followed by zero or more of the suffixes ``_alpha``, ``_beta``, ``_pre``, ``_rc`` or ``_p``,
each of which may optionally be followed by an unsigned integer.
Suffix and integer count as separate version components.

This may optionally be followed by the suffix ``-r`` followed immediately by an unsigned integer (the “revision number”).
If this suffix is not present, it is assumed to be ``-r0``.

E.g. Using all the components: ``1.2.3a_alpha12-r3``.

For the version comparison algorithm, see `Section 3.3 of the Package Manager Specification <https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/7/pms.html#x1-260003.3>`_.

Portmod's package names and versions generally follow `Section 3 of the Package Manager Specification <https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/7/pms.html#x1-150003>`_, with some exceptions.
