Rubato is a modern 2D game engine for python. Accurate fixed-step physics simulations, robust scene and game object management, event listener system and more all come prepackaged.

Rubato is built developer-first. From intricate rigidbody simulations to 2D games, Rubato streamlines development for beginners and the poweruser. And all that finally with some legible documentation.

Rubato has now completed the transition to SDL2. The final PyGame-based release was 1.2, and is considered depricated. This has allowed us to implement more complex features not supported by PyGame such as antialiasing and hardware acceleration. If you would like to read more about PySDL2 or need to utilize its underlying functionality in your project, you can read the python wrapper documentation [here](https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.11/) and the base C++ SDL wiki [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org).

_Wondering about the name? Rubato is a music term that indicates a phrase that should be performed expressively and freely. We aim to harness that same freedom, bringing a fresh, modern take on game developement in python to a variety of users regardless of their coding background._
