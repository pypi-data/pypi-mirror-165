# ocf_datapipes
OCF's DataPipe based dataloader for training and inference


## Adding a new DataPipe
A general outline for a new DataPipe should go something
like this:

```python
from torchdata.datapipes.iter import IterDataPipe
from torchdata.datapipes import functional_datapipe

@functional_datapipe("<pipelet_name>")
class <PipeletName>IterDataPipe(IterDataPipe):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __iter__(self):
        pass
```

### Experimental DataPipes

For new datapipes being developed for new models or input modalities, to somewhat separate the more experimental and in
development datapipes from the ones better tested for production purposes, there is an `ocf_datapipes.experimental` namespace for
developing these more research-y datapipes. These datapipes might not, and probably are not, tested.
Once the model(s) using them are in production, they should be upgraded to one of the other namespaces and have tests added.
