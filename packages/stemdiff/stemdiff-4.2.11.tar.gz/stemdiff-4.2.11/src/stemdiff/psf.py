def psf_from_lowS_files(
        DBASE,SUMMATION,R=RESCALE,S=None,P=None,N=None):
    '''
    Extract 2D-PSF from datafiles with low Shannon entropy S.
    PSF (= point-spread function) is taken from the central region/spot.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    DBASE : str or pandas.DataFrame
        Database with columns: DatafileName,Entropy,Xcenter,Ycenter.
        The database is either read from file (if DBASE = str = filename)
        or from pandas.Dataframe (if DBASE = directly pandas.DataFrame).
    SUMMATION : summation object
        Summation parameters; here we need the size/edge
        of the central square, from which 2D-PSF will be determined.
    R : integer, optional, default is stemdiff.const.RESCALE
        Rescale coefficient; PSF function is rescaled/enlarged R-times.
    S : float
        Shannon entropy value;
        if S is given, PSF will be extracted only from files with entropy < S.
    P : float
        Percent of files with the lowest entropy;
        if P is given, PSF will be extracted only from the P% of low-S files.
    N : integer
        Number of files with the lowest entropy;
        if N is given, PSF will be extracted from N files with the lowest S.
    
    Returns
    -------
    2D numpy array
        The array with the saved 2D-PSF function, which represents
        the experimentally determined XY-spread of the primary beam.
        The array is a sum of central areas/spots of input datafiles
        (divided by number of summed datafiles to get reasonable scale).
        
    Notes
    -----
    * Priority of parameters: S > P > N.
    * Therefore, if S is given, P and N are ignored etc.

    * This function is usually not called directly.
    * Usually it is called from function *psf_from_lowS_files*.
    * The calling function prepares the low-entropy files as DataFrame = df.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    df: pandas DataFrame row iterator
        DataFrame columns: DatafileName,Entropy,Xcenter,Ycenter.
        We use iterator as the 4D-STEM datasets/databases can be rather large.
    SUMMATION: summation object
        Summation parameters; here we need the SUMMATION.psfsize
        = edge of the central square, from which 2D-PSF will be determined.
        If SUMMATION.psfsize is not given => take PSF from the whole array.
    R: integer
        Rescale coefficient;
        PSF function is rescaled/enlarged R-times.
        Typical values of R are 2 or 4; default is stemdiff.const.RESCALE.
