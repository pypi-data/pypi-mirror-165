# Inverse Text Normalization

A simple, deterministic, and extensible approach to [inverse text normalization](https://www.google.com/search?q=inverse+text+normalization) (ITN) for numbers.

## Overview

A [csv](https://github.com/Brandhsu/itnpy/tree/master/assets/vocab.csv) file is provided to define the basic rules for transforming spoken form numbers into numerical digits, and extra post-processing may be applied for more specific formatting requirements, i.e. dates, measurements, money, etc.
