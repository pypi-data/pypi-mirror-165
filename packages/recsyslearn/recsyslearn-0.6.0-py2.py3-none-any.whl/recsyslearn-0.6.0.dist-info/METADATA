A small library to compute fairness of recommender systems.


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://recsyslearn.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Compute Novelty of a recommender system based on its recommendations list.
* Compute Coverage of a recommender system based on its recommendations list.
* Compute Entropy of a recommender system based on its recommendations list.
* Compute Kullback-Leibler divergence of a recommender system based on its recommendations list and the wanted target representation.
* Compute Mutual Information of a recommender system based on its recommendations list.
* Segment an implicit or explicit dataset in groups based on the activity of the users or on the popularity of the items.

Known Issues
------------

In this version of the library, the computation of the metrics for cross groups (user and item groups together) has not been implemented yet.
